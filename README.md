# Information

This text editor comes with neat features, like fully customisable syntax highlighting for any file.
Currently this includes some basic highlighting for numbers, strings and multiline and single line comments in .c|.h|.cpp files!
You can change these however you like, just look through the code and have fun!

# How to install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiveEmily/nextpad.git
cd nextpad
make
```
### Optional

Place the executable in the binary folder for system wide use **VERY NOT RECOMMENDED**
```bash
cp main /usr/bin/
```
