# Hi, this file was fully written in nextpad!

This text editor comes with neat features,
like fully customisable syntax hightlighting for any file.
Currently this includes some basic highlighting for numbers, strings and multiline and single line comments in .c|.h|.cpp files!
You can change these however you like, just look through the code and have fun!

UI inspired by VIM, not 100% functional and might break.
